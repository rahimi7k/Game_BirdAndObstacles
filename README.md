# Game_BirdAndObstacles
This project presents a 2D game developed in TypeScript as part of my bachelor's degree thesis. The game engine was built entirely from scratch without relying on third-party libraries, utilizing WebGL (Web Graphics Library) and GLSL for rendering objects. The engine is designed to support both 2D and 3D graphical objects, with the game itself showcasing the capabilities of this advanced engine.

For a deeper understanding of the graphical design and development process, refer to my undergraduate thesis, “Designing and Implementing a Game Engine with Typescript and WebGL: Bird and Obstacles 2D Game.” The thesis covers the fundamentals of game development, the history of games, graphic language (GLSL), and object rendering.
